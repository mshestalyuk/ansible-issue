English:

This is a test task, where you need to try to deploy the project and find the cause of the malfunction. For testing, I recommend using Vagrant.

The task's legend is quite simple. Imagine you've been hired, and the old admin or DevOps—who knows how they even referred to themselves—ran off somewhere and stopped responding to messages. All you know is that the website was deployed using Ansible, but now, for some reason, the project doesn't work when trying to deploy it. The only thing you know for sure is that before running off, the website was moved from one hosting provider to another. The problem likely lies there.

Try deploying the project and finding the cause. Good luck!
